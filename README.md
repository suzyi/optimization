### CVXOPT
+ [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/) is a free software package for convex optimization based on the Python programming language, developed by Martin Andersen, Joachim Dahl, and Lieven Vandenberghe.
+ [variables](http://cvxopt.org/userguide/modeling.html#variables)- It seems like variables can only be vector variable, from official guide.
### CVXPY
+ [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/) is a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems, Steven Diamond, Eric Chu, Akshay Agrawal and Stephen Boyd.
+ [github for cvxpy](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy)
+ [Variables](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/intro/index.html) can be scalars, vectors, or matrices, meaning they are 0, 1, or 2 dimensional.
+ [library of examples](http://www.cvxpy.org/examples/index.html)
### CVX
+ [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) is a Matlab-based modeling system for convex optimization, developed by Michael Grant and Stephen Boyd. 
+ [Variables](http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/basics.html) can be real or complex scalars, vectors, matrices, or n-dimensional arrays.
